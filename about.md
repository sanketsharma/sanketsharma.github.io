I am a fifth year PhD student in physics at the department of physics, 
University of Tennessee, Knoxville. My research involves applying quantum
computations to solve problems in nuclear physics. My advisor is [Dr. Lucas Platter](http://www.phys.utk.edu/people/faculty/platter.html).
I also work closely with [Dr. Thomas Papenbrock](http://www.phys.utk.edu/people/faculty/papenbrock.html). My hobbies include reading and 
tinkering with computers. Please see my [publications](/publications/) and [talks](/talks/).
