I am a fifth year PhD student in physics at the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.utk.edu/), 
University of Tennessee, Knoxville. My research involves applying quantum
computations to solve problems in nuclear physics. My advisor is [Dr. Lucas Platter](https://physics.utk.edu/people/instructional-faculty/platter-lucas/).
I also work closely with [Dr. Thomas Papenbrock](https://physics.utk.edu/people/instructional-faculty/papenbrock-thomas/). My hobbies include reading and 
tinkering with computers. Please see my [publications](/publications/) and [talks](/talks/).
